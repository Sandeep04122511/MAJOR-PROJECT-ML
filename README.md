🔍 Major Project: Data Exploration and Visualization – Housing Price Analysis

I successfully completed a comprehensive data analysis and visualization project using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) on a real-world housing dataset (housing.csv). Key findings from the project include:

🏠 Price Range Distribution
Analyzed and visualized how many houses fall within the following price ranges:

₹0–25 Lakhs

₹26–50 Lakhs

₹51–75 Lakhs

₹76–100 Lakhs

₹>100 Lakhs
📈 A line chart was created to clearly show the distribution and market segmentation.

❄️ AC vs Non-AC House Pricing
Calculated and compared the average prices of houses with and without air conditioning.
📊 A bar chart was plotted to visualize the price difference, indicating how modern amenities affect house value.

🚗 Parking vs Price Relationship
Simulated and studied how parking availability impacts house price. The analysis showed a positive correlation—properties with dedicated parking spaces tend to be priced higher.

📐 Premium Property Gap Analysis
Compared houses with:

<5000 sqft & no preferred area
vs

>5000 sqft & in a preferred area
The result revealed a significant price gap, emphasizing how both size and location preference contribute to property valuation.

🛠️ Tools Used: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
📊 Skills Applied: Data Cleaning, Grouping, Aggregation, Conditional Filtering, Visualization

💡 This project helped me strengthen my data analytics and storytelling skills using real estate market data. Open to feedback and collaboration!
